                <h2>ARTIST STATEMENT </h2>
                <p>
                    My practice is based on my experience and interaction with people about their
                    emotions, ideologies, beliefs, social values, certain moral conducts. I try to
                    portray human behaviors in particular situations through my work. The title of
                    my works is an entry point to my thoughts.
                   <br><br> My works are informed by a variety of pictorial traditions such as surrealism,
                    realism, Indian classical and Western Art and so on. I appropriate images from
                    popular visual culture. I choose various materials according to the requirements
                    of my work. I also use unconventional materials and try to push the possibilities
                    to make new visuals to best communicate my ideas. After My Internship in
                    traditional miniature painting in Jaipur, I tried to develop the technical aspect of
                    certain works and developed a few works accordingly.
                    <br><br>I also interact with people to make my work powerful. I like to go through a
                    research and development process before executing each of my ideas.<br><br>
